My name is Tom Reynolds.  I currently work as a pathfinding data scientist at Intel.  Prior to that, I worked for
Intel's process technology development division for multiple process nodes where I was responsible for analyzing a metric ton
of yield data and driving the improvement of the process yields.  I managed their Defect Metrology group for over 5 years.

### Educational Background

I have a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Cornell University.  Prior to that, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Chemistry from UCLA.
